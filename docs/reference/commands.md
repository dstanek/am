# Commands

Complete reference for all `am` commands.

---

## `am init`

Initialize a new `am` project in the current repository.

**Usage**

```sh
am init
```

**What it does**

- Creates the `.am/` directory at the repository root
- Writes a default `.am/config.toml` with all settings commented out
- Creates an empty `.am/sessions.json` to hold session state
- Appends `.am/` to `.gitignore` (creates `.gitignore` if it does not exist)

Running `am init` in a directory that is not a git or jj repository is an error. Running it a second time in the same repository is safe — existing files are not overwritten.

!!! note
    `am init` must be run from inside a git or jj repository. `am` detects `.jj/` first; if not found it checks for `.git/`. If neither is present, the command exits with an error.

---

## `am start <slug>`

Create a new isolated agent session.

**Usage**

```sh
am start <slug> [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `<slug>` | Session name. Must be 1–40 characters, using only lowercase letters (`a–z`), digits (`0–9`), hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`). |

**Options**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--agent <AGENT>` | Agent command to launch in the session's agent pane. Overrides the `agent` value from config. Supported integrations: `claude`, `copilot`, `gemini`, `codex`. Any other value is treated as a raw executable with no credential mounts. See [Concepts](../concepts.md#agent-integrations) for details. |
| `--no-container` | Disable container isolation for this session. The agent command will run directly in the tmux pane instead of inside a container. |
| `--auto` | Launch the agent in autonomous mode (passes agent-specific flags to skip interactive prompts, e.g. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for Claude). Requires `--agent` and container to be enabled. |

**What it does**

1. Validates the slug
2. Creates a git worktree at `.am/worktrees/<slug>` on a new `am/<slug>` branch (or a jj workspace if the repo uses jj)
3. If inside tmux: opens a new window named `am-<slug>` with a split pane; sets up the agent pane and the shell pane
4. If container is enabled: launches the container with the appropriate mounts and environment variables
5. Sends the agent command to the agent pane
6. Records the session in `.am/sessions.json`

If `am start` is run outside of tmux, it creates the worktree and then launches the container directly (replacing the current shell process via `exec()`). No tmux window is created.

---

## `am list`

List all active sessions for the current project.

**Usage**

```sh
am list
```

Reads from `.am/sessions.json` and prints a table of all recorded sessions. If there are no sessions, prints a friendly message instead.

**Output columns**

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `SLUG` | The session name |
| `CONTAINER` | Container runtime in use (`podman`, `docker`), or `—` if no container |
| `AUTO` | `yes` if the session was started with `--auto`, otherwise `—` |
| `WORKTREE` | Absolute path to the session's git worktree or jj workspace |
| `WINDOW` | The tmux window name (`am-<slug>`) |
| `CREATED` | Timestamp when the session was created (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`) |

**Example output**

```
SLUG    CONTAINER  AUTO  WORKTREE                          WINDOW     CREATED
feat    podman     —     /home/user/proj/.am/worktrees/feat am-feat    2026-04-12 09:00
bugfix  —          —     /home/user/proj/.am/worktrees/bugfix am-bugfix 2026-04-12 08:47
```

## `am attach <slug>`

Attach to an existing session's tmux window.

**Usage**

```sh
am attach <slug>
```

Switches the current tmux client to the `am-<slug>` window. If the window does not exist (for example, after a system restart), `am attach` creates a new window and split for the session — it does not error.

!!! warning "Requires tmux"
    `am attach` must be run from inside a tmux session. If `$TMUX` is not set, the command exits with an error. To get a terminal inside an existing session without tmux, navigate directly to `.am/worktrees/<slug>`.

---

## `am run <slug> <agent>`

Send an agent command to a session's agent pane.

**Usage**

```sh
am run <slug> <agent>
```

Uses `tmux send-keys` to send the specified agent command to the agent pane of the `am-<slug>` window, followed by Enter. This is useful for (re)starting an agent in a session that was started without one, or after the agent process has exited.

**Example**

```sh
am run feat claude
```

!!! warning "Requires tmux"
    `am run` must be run from inside a tmux session. If `$TMUX` is not set, the command exits with an error.

---

## `am destroy <slug>`

Destroy an agent session.

**Usage**

```sh
am destroy <slug> [OPTIONS]
```

**Options**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--force`, `-f` | Skip the confirmation prompt and proceed immediately. |

**What it does**

1. Stops the container (`podman stop am-<slug>` or equivalent)
2. Removes the container (`podman rm am-<slug>` or equivalent)
3. Kills the tmux window `am-<slug>` (skipped if the window no longer exists)
4. Removes the git worktree at `.am/worktrees/<slug>` and deletes the `am/<slug>` branch
5. Removes the session record from `.am/sessions.json`

Without `--force`, `am` prints a summary of what will be destroyed and asks for confirmation. This is the only destructive command in `am` and cannot be undone — the worktree and branch are permanently deleted.

---

## `am generate-config`

Print a fully-documented configuration template to stdout.

**Usage**

```sh
am generate-config
am generate-config > ~/.config/am/config.toml
```

Prints a complete `config.toml` template with every supported setting, its default value, and an explanatory comment. All settings are commented out so that the compiled-in defaults apply unless explicitly uncommented.

Useful for seeding either the global config or a project config:

```sh
# Create global config
mkdir -p ~/.config/am
am generate-config > ~/.config/am/config.toml

# Create project config (am init does this automatically)
am generate-config > .am/config.toml
```

---

## Slug validation

Slugs are the short names used to identify sessions. The following rules apply:

- **Length:** 1–40 characters
- **Characters:** only lowercase letters (`a–z`), digits (`0–9`), hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`)
- **Pattern:** `[a-z0-9_-]{1,40}`

Slugs that do not match these rules are rejected immediately by `am start` with an error message, before any side effects occur.

**Valid examples**

```
feat
fix-auth
my_feature
v2
release-2026-03
```

**Invalid examples**

```
MyFeature       # uppercase letters not allowed
fix auth        # spaces not allowed
-leading-dash   # must start with a letter or digit
```
